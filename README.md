# PyQt-Dev-Work

# üìò BUS 442 ‚Äì Information Systems Development
This repository contains hands-on development work completed as part of **BUS 442: Information Systems Development** at NC State University. The course focused on applying software design principles using Python, Java, and UI frameworks such as PyQt6, with an emphasis on modular design, event-driven programming, and real-world project simulations.
